<p>Once a mighty republic, Venice is now a magnet for tourists. It definitely has a special
    atmosphere. The architecture, the canals, the gondolas and the glorious history of the city.
    Through the small streets and canals you can discover charming details. Signs, street lamps, windows with
    shutters,
    balconies with flowers and bridges. It's great to get lost right here, between the walls, where history wafts
    around
    every corner. One immerses oneself in a bygone era.</p>

            One end of the canal leads into the lagoon near the Santa Lucia railway station, and the other end leads

            neighborhoods ( sestieri ) of Venice.
            It's long 3.8 km and is 30 to 90 m wide, with an average depth of 5 meters . The banks of the Grand Canal
            are lined with more than 170 buildings, most of which date from the 13th to the 18th centuries and showcase

            St. Mark's Square is located in the center of Venice and is its main square, also called "the official salon
            of Europe". For hundreds of years, the square has been the center of the political, religious and social
            life of the city. In this square there are also the most important buildings in Venice that dictated the
            rhythm of the daily life of the Venetians â€“ the Doge's Palace, the Cathedral of San Marco, the Bell Tower,
            the clock and the buildings of the New and Old Procurations.
