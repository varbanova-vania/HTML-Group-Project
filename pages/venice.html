    <p>Once a mighty republic, Venice is now a magnet for tourists. It definitely has a special
        atmosphere. The architecture, the canals, the gondolas and the glorious history of the city.
        Through the small streets and canals you can discover charming details. Signs, street lamps, windows with
        shutters,
        balconies with flowers and bridges. It's great to get lost right here, between the walls, where history wafts
        around
        every corner. One immerses oneself in a bygone era.</p>

                <h2>Canal Grand </h2>
                <p> One end of the canal leads into the lagoon near the Santa Lucia railway station, and the other end leads into the basin of San Marco; between them it makes a large inverted S shape through the central neighborhoods ( sestieri ) of Venice.
                    It's long 3.8 km and is 30 to 90 m  wide, with an average depth of 5 meters . The banks of the Grand Canal are lined with more than 170 buildings, most of which date from the 13th to the 18th centuries and showcase the wealth and art created by the Republic of Venice.</p>

                <h2>Venetian gondolas </h2>
                <p>Gondolas are the trademark of Venice. Although water channels picturesquely divide the territory of other cities around the world, only in Venice the movement through them has been done for centuries by gondolas. up to 1.60 m. Centuries-old traditions are like a law that cannot be broken. Like blue blood, the profession of a gondolier is passed down from father to son.
                    Unless you belong to a family of gondoliers, it is almost impossible to enter their caste. </p>
