    <p>Dancing to its own beat, the Dutch capital Amsterdam is famous for its unusual life rhythm that is
        manifested in the air of canals, coffee shops, and the Red-Light District, as well as many other things
        that altogether draw annually over five million visitors to the city.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>A place where “hipness meets history”, Amsterdam emerged in the late 12th century as a small fishing village
        around a dam on the Amstel River; hence its original name “Amstelredamme”.</p>
