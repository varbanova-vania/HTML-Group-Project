<h1>AMSTERDAM</h1>
<p>Dancing to its own beat, the Dutch capital Amsterdam is famous for its unusual life rhythm that is manifested in
    the air of canals, coffee shops, and the Red-Light District, as well as many other things that altogether draw
    annually over five million visitors to the city.</p>
<p>A place where “hipness meets history”, Amsterdam emerged in the late 12th century as a small fishing village
    around a dam on the Amstel River; hence its original name “Amstelredamme”.</p>
