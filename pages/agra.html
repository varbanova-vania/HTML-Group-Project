        <h2>Agra Fort</h2>
        <p>Near the gardens of the Taj Mahal stands the important 16th-century Mughal
            monument known as the Red Fort of Agra.
            This powerful fortress of red sandstone encompasses, within its 2.5-km-long enclosure walls,
            the imperial city of the Mughal rulers. It comprises many fairy-tale palaces,
            such as the Jahangir Palace and the Khas Mahal, built by Shah Jahan; audience halls,
            such as the Diwan-i-Khas; and two very beautiful mosques.</p>

        <h2>Fatehpur Sikri</h2>
        <p>Fatehpur Sikri is located in Agra District in the State of Uttar Pradesh in northern India.
            It was constructed southeast of an artificial lake,
            on the slopping levels of the outcrops of the Vindhyan hill ranges.
            Known as the “city of victory”, it was made capital by the Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605 CE)
            and constructed between 1571 and 1573. Fatehpur Sikri was the first planned
            city of the Mughals to be marked by magnificent administrative, residential,
            and religious buildings comprised of palaces, public buildings, mosques, and living areas for the court,
            the army, the servants of the king and an entire city. </p>
