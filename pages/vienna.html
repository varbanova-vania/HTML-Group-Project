        <p><b>St. Stephen's Cathedral is the symbol of Vienna and also the very center of the city.
            At 136 meters in height, it is the tallest church in Austria.</b></p>
        <p>St. Stephen's Cathedral in the heart of the inner city is 107 meters long. The tallest of its four towers is the south tower at 136 meters. The tower room, from which there is a gigantic view across Vienna,
            is reached via 343 steps. A total of 13 bells hang here. However, the best known of them, the Pummerin, hangs in the 68 meter-tall north tower. It is the second-biggest free-swinging chimed church bell in Europe.
            On the roof of St. Stephen's Cathedral, colorful roof tiles were laid to create the Royal and Imperial double-headed eagle and the coat of arms of the city of Vienna.
            St. Stephen's Cathedral also attained a particular reputation due to Vienna's most famous sweet treat: It soars above the brand logo on the pink-red packaging of the Manner Schnitten slices.</p>

        <p>For more than seven centuries, the empire of the Habsburgs was ruled from here. Even after the monarchy, it remains the official seat of the Austrian head of state – the federal president.
            From the 13th century onwards, the Habsburgs expanded this huge palace in stages to a total floor area of over 300,000 m2. Vienna's Imperial Palace is thus one of the biggest integrated palace complexes in the world.</p>

        <p><b>The mighty green dome of the radiant Karlskirche (Church of St. Charles) towers over Karlsplatz.
            It is one of the most important sacred buildings in Central Europe and a symbol of Vienna.</b></p>
        <p>The Karlskirche (Church of St. Charles) is the last great work of the eminent Baroque architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach.
            Completed in 1739, it was built by virtue of a vow made by Emperor Charles VI during a plague. The church is dedicated to the Habsburg emperor's namesake, St. Karl Borromäus. His life and works are depicted on the two giant columns (47 meters tall) next to the entrance portal.
            The lavish dome frescoes by Johannes Michael Rottmayr cover 1,250 m² of magnificent color.</p>
